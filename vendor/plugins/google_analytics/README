GoogleAnalytics
===============

This is a quick 'n' dirty module to easily enable Google Analytics support
in your application.  By default it'll output the analytics code for every
single page automatically, if it's configured correctly.  This is done by
adding:

    Rubaidh::GoogleAnalytics.tracker_id = 'UA-12345-67'

to your `config/environment.rb`, inserting your own tracker id. This can be
discovered by looking at the value assigned to +_uacct+ in the Javascript
code.

If you want to disable the code insertion for particular pages, add the following to controllers that don't want it:

    skip_after_filter :add_google_analytics_code

If you are running rails 2.1 or above add install this by adding:
    
    config.gem 'markcatley-google_analytics', :lib => 'rubaidh/google_analytics', :source => 'http://gems.github.com'
    
and run:

    rake gems:install

Simple. :-)


NOTE

This version of the plugin uses the new Google Analytics code (ga.js) by
default.  To use the legacy tracking code add the following line to your
`config/environment.rb`:

    Rubaidh::GoogleAnalytics.legacy_mode = true

TRACKING OUTBOUND LINKS

Google Analytics only tracks intra-site links by default. To create an outbound link that is tracked use
the link_to_tracked helper:

link_to_tracked(name, track_path = "/", options = {}, html_options = {})

You can use the track_path parameter to group your outbound links into logical folders inside of
Google Analytics.

The other forms of link_to are also supported:

link_to_tracked_if(condition, name, track_path = "/", options = {}, html_options = {}, &block)
link_to_tracked_unless(condition, name, track_path = "/", options = {}, html_options = {}, &block)
link_to_tracked_unless_current(name, track_path = "/", options = {}, html_options = {}, &block)

Tracked links respect the legacy_mode flag.

Note: Link-tracking works by inserting onclick() code in the HTML. Because of this, it will overwrite
any onclick that you insert in the html_options hash.
